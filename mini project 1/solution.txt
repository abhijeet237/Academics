1.
lambda = 5 min
E(X) = 1/lambda = 1/5 = 0.2
exponential distribution
lat X_1, X_2, X_3 be three execution times

we generate random value of each of above in each iteration for 10,000 iterations

cal X  and then cal X^2 as a whole.

Now, compare calculated value of X^2 with the one that is calculated.
